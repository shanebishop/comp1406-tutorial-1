# comp1406-tutorial-1
Some Java classes I wrote in my first COMP 1406 tutorial

The objectives for tutorial 1 were as follows:
 - Write, compile, and run simple Java programs using the IntelliJ Idea IDE
 - Practice writing programs that require user input and formatted output
 - Practice using and creating simple objects
